In Jenkins, the error Scripts not permitted to use staticmethod java.time.ZonedDateTime now occurs because Jenkins’ Groovy Sandbox restricts certain Java methods for security reasons. You can either:

1. Approve the method through the Jenkins script approval process (if you have admin rights).


2. Use a workaround that is compatible with the Groovy Sandbox.



Option 1: Approve the method (requires admin access)

If you have admin rights, you can approve the method by following these steps:

1. Run the pipeline once. It will fail and ask for script approval.


2. Navigate to Manage Jenkins → In-process Script Approval.


3. Approve the necessary signatures (in this case, staticMethod java.time.ZonedDateTime now).



Option 2: Workaround for Jenkins Sandbox

If you can't approve the script, you can use an alternative method that is sandbox-friendly, by working with more Groovy-based libraries like Date and TimeZone. Here’s a sandbox-friendly version using Date:

def getUtcTimeFromLocal() {
    // Get the current local time
    def now = new Date()

    // Get the UTC timezone
    TimeZone utcTimeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC")

    // Create a formatter and set its time zone to UTC
    def dateFormat = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
    dateFormat.setTimeZone(utcTimeZone)

    // Return the formatted UTC time
    return dateFormat.format(now)
}

// Example usage in Jenkins pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Get UTC Time') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def utcTime = getUtcTimeFromLocal()
                    echo "Current UTC Time: ${utcTime}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

new Date(): Gets the current local time.

TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"): Retrieves the UTC time zone.

SimpleDateFormat: Formats the date and time string according to the pattern yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, and the time zone is set to UTC.


This method is compatible with the Jenkins Groovy sandbox and should work without requiring any additional script approval.
